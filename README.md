# Java Programs
These are several Java programs that I made for my Problem Solving and Programming Concepts course. Feel free to use them however you like.

# Soccer Team Roster
The soccer team roster program allows users to add, replace, and modify `Player` class objects within the team. Additionally, it also features insertion sort to filter results by rank.  

Initial player data is populated from the `SoccerPlayers.txt` file once the program starts.

# Employee System 
This was an assignment that was designed to teach about object oriented programming. There are various different methods to interface with the `Employee` class. 

# Pizza Calculator
This program calculates the total cost of pizzas by prompting the user to input the number of small, medium, and large pizzas.

<b>Example Output</b>
